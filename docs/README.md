# Introduction

React Infinite Scroll is an component which implements the functionality of infinitely scrolling. It helps you write less code when you want a component scroll infinitely in your application.

## Easy to use

To make React Infinite Scroll work, you just need to tell it whether your application is loading and are there more data to load, then create your `Item` component with `React.forwardRef` and an array with a specific type. Finally, pass a function which should be called when the last item displayed in the viewport.

## No pollution

React Infinite Scroll does not add extra HTML elements to your application. That is, you don't have to worry about adding extra styling because it doesn't break you DOM structure.
